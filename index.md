Whatever path brought you here, feel free to browse.

I occasionally put stuff on here related to my work, my life or things that interest me.
It is not a blog nor a portfolio. Just a page for anything I decide to put there.

[StackOverflow profile](http://stackoverflow.com/users/204693/florian-peschka), or directly view my
[resume](http://stackoverflow.com/cv/florianpeschka).

I'm open to talk about almost anything, so just contact me and we can have a chat.

This is pretty boring stuff mostly, but hey - I wrote it, it got me a degree, so there it is.
