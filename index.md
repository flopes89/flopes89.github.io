Whatever path brought you here, feel free to browse.

I occasionally put stuff on here related to my work, my life or things that interest me. It is not a blog nor a portfolio. It is a playground for me and everything that I desire.

If you want to get to know me professionally, check out my [StackOverflow profile](http://stackoverflow.com/users/204693/florian-peschka), or directly view my [resume](http://stackoverflow.com/cv/florianpeschka).

I'm open to many things, so just contact me and we can have a chat.
