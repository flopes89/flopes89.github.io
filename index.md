Whatever path brought you here, feel free to browse.

I occasionally put stuff on here related to my work, my life or things that interest me.
It is not a blog nor a portfolio. Just a page for anything I decide to put there.

[Here you'll find](./dhbw) all the things I did for my Bachelor's Degree at the DHBW (T1000, T2000, T3000, T3300).

This is pretty boring stuff mostly, but hey - I wrote it, it got me a degree, so there it is.
